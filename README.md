*Just playing around here. I wanted to see how randomly layered NFTs were generated.*

### Installation
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Before
If you want to upload to IPFS via Infra, you need to get an account. Then acquire the
Project ID and Secret ID. You'll need to set the environment variables
`INFURA_PROJECT_ID` and `INFURA_PROJECT_SECRET` with the corresponding value.
### Usage
`python3 create-avatar.py <number_to_generate> [--preview] [--upload]`
